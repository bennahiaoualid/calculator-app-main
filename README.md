## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge was to build a calculator app with basic arithmetic operations and toggle themes.

Users should be able to:

- Reset the calculator to its initial state
- Toggle between different themes (light, dark, and neon)
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size

### What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to build a functional calculator app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I practiced implementing arithmetic operations, handling user input, and updating the display accordingly. Additionally, I gained experience in creating responsive layouts, implementing theme toggling, and ensuring a smooth user experience.

### Continued Development

Moving forward, I plan to continue enhancing my skills in JavaScript, focusing on improving code organization, modularization, and error handling. I also aim to explore more advanced JavaScript concepts like working with APIs and implementing more complex calculations. Additionally, I will continue to improve my responsive web design skills and accessibility practices.
